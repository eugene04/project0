    <h1>I love sports</h1>

<p>From a very young age, I have had a huge passion for sports and competition. I tried my hand at a few different sports growing up, and went on to compete at the highest level in basketball during my high schools years. Earlier on during my primary school days, I was quite an avid footballer and even played for Zimbabwe Saints (juniors), the second oldest football club in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>For me, there is something about working hard, competing and getting better. Throughout my life, I have spent countless hours by myself hitting against a backboard and playing ball or watching sport on TV simply because I loved it. My passion for sports was fostered by several positive people and coaches who taught me what sports are really about.</p>
<p>To these influences, winning wasnâ€™t always as important as trying my best, having fun and displaying good sportsmanship. Playing sports with these goals and values, rather than the pressure to win, developed my love for sports and I began to spend lots of time playing or watching them.</p>
<p>While many coaches have played a huge role in my development, none have taught me as much as my friends and teammates. My dreams in sports are mine, not theirs, and they always understood this. I think it is very important that coaches and whoever else is considered a positive influence to understand what a young athlete really wants at a given stage and not push him or her too fast or too far so that the love is lost.</p>
<p>Sports weren't something I just did, but had become a part of me. It was for the love of playing the game, as well as bonding with teammates that became lifelong friends. Sports did build my character and implemented valuable qualities that I continue to use in everyday life. They taught me teamwork, communication, and gave me a sense of accomplishment. I loved the competition and always strove to be better. It was safe to say my life revolved around sports.</p>
<p>Today I take all these experiences and channel them towards supporting for my favourite teams and athletes. I grew up idolising Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls as well as Liverpool Football Club and to this day I still have a bit of a fervent love for both the Bulls and Liverpool. I still have a fervent love for both basketball and football although I hardly get an opportunity to play myself.</p>
<p>My downtime is an afternoon well-spent watching football or basketball getting a kick from the near-competitive fanaticism between my friends and I as we go to town about whose team is the best. <a href="#top">(Back to top of page)</a></p>
