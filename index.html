        <h4>Greetings</h4>
       <p> My name is Eugene Garikayi Jemwa.I am 40 years old and was born and raised in Zimbabweâ€™s second largest city Bulawayo.</p>
        <p>I have always been interested in technology but opportunities to learn have been few in my country, fortunately I discovered <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50 on edx</a> and I believe a whole new world has opened up for me. I look forward to the exciting new journey I am taking in web programming.</p>
        <p>I believe life is too short and should be enjoyed to the fullest my interests are as follows:</p>

       <h1> <a href="sports.html">Sports </a></h1>

       <p>From a very young age, I have had a huge passion for sports and competition. I tried my hand at a few different sports growing up, and went on to compete at the highest level in basketball during my high schools years. Earlier on during my primary school days, I was quite an avid footballer and even played for Zimbabwe Saints (juniors), the second oldest football club in Zimbabwe. <a href="sports.html">read more.... </a></p>
