        <h4>Greetings</h4>
       <p> My name is Eugene Garikayi Jemwa.I am 40 years old and was born and raised in Zimbabweâ€™s second largest city Bulawayo.</p>
        <p>I have always been interested in technology but opportunities to learn have been few in my country, fortunately I discovered <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50 on edx</a> and I believe a whole new world has opened up for me. I look forward to the exciting new journey I am taking in web programming.</p>
